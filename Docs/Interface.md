Prism functions are accessed through the Prism menu in the top bar of Fusion Studio's UI.  The menu will look familar to Prism users and contain the normal Prism functions.

When Fusion is opened, and popup will display to allow the user to launch the Prism integration.

The Prism functions are running in a dedicated process, so please note that only one Prism Fusion window can be open at a time.  For example if a user has the State Manager open through Fusion, it must be closed before the Project Browser ma be opened.

The "RESET PRISM" button will restart/reload the Prism Functions inside of Fusion, and can be used if there are any glitches with Prism while Fusion is open.

This integration into Fusion Studio uses Prism's State Manager and Project Browser for image rendering and importing.
