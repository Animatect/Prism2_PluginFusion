## **Notes**

- Loader and Saver version management.
- Rendering through Prism's State Manager.
- Farm Render submission through Deadline.
- This intergration has been tested with Fusion Studio versions 18 and 19.
- This integration does not work with Resolve Fusion, thought it is planned for the future.
- Sometimes the Startup Popup appears twice.  Sarting twice has no adverse affects.
- As of Prism version 2.0.12, the automatic Media Conversion is not able to function.  This should be working with the next Prism update.
- To aid is use, tooltips are provided throughout.
